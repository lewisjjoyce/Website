      <p>There once was a boy named <i><b>trimwop</b></i> who loved to paint pictures of his mum.<br/>
         He had seven friends in total, if you include his clay models, zero if we exclude them.
      </p>
      <!-- We all love Trimwop, eh?-->
      <p>Grammar was not <i style="color:red; background-color:turquoise;">Trimwop's</i> greatest strength; he had never heard of a full stop.</p>

      <p>VVVVVVVV. Trimwop's mum obliged, with the whirring of the rotation mechanism causing the ground to vibrate like a sock full of wasps.

      <p>Trimwop's mother was no human. It was not even living. It was a vacuum cleaner drilled to a swegway with an Alexa voice control unit taped to the handle.</p>
